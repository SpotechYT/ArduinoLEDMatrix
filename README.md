# ArduinoLEDMatrix
Simple Code to run a LED Matrix using arduino
The Wiring is very simple as demonstrated by the schematic I created
Can be scalled up or down

# Thanks for the help!
Credits to http://www.multiwingspan.co.uk/arduino.php?page=matrix for the basic coding ideas and functions

# Code overview
I created a simple test animation in the Loop function
Not much to go over, LEDS are initialized in the setup and I created helper functions to turn on specifc LEDS

# This took some time to make!
Feel free to use this code for you own projects, but if you will publish anything online, mention me ;)
